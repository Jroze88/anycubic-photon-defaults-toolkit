Requirements:motherboard firmware must > V1. 3. 7
Support for androi, ios
Communication method: UDP protocol, 3000 ports
Communication mode：
Mobile terminal: send command
Device side: successful return ok\r \ \ n
Some commands will also display additional information before, if not specifically indicated, the success only return ok \ r\n, otherwise return the relevant information and then return
Back to ok\ \ r \ \ n
Failure returns Error:+ error message\r\n
All the commands are based on the handshake operation, in the face of G28 this long operation command, it is recommended to set the longest probably 5s socket ultra
When, once timed out, sends the M4004 command to query the current status
Basic commands：
M99999
Local Area Network broadcast, through this instruction to scan the device
ok MAC:18:fe:34:d7:a7:16 IP:192.168.1.106 VER:V10. 0. 3 ID:38, d9, 5d, fa, dd,8b, 1a, 4d
NAME:yiyu-esp1
MAC:wifi mac address
IP: WiFi LAN IP address
VER: version number of the wifi firmware
ID: unique identification of the wifi module
NAME: set WiFi module name
Get the device's xyze step parameters, step parameters will be used in subsequent file compression.The first command after the connection must be this
All the commands that you can't follow are unresponsive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
M4001
ok. X:0.0127 Y:0.0127 Z:0.00125 E:0.00225 T:0/200/200/200/1 U: 'UTF-8'B:0
# T after the parameters for the machine type / x Stroke / y stroke / Z stroke / nozzle number 0: xyz Model 1: delta model
, For delta models, x-Stroke=y-stroke=delta radius parameter Z for delta Z maximum debugging
#U is connected to the back of the motherboard coding, B: followed by whether to enable the hot bed
Get status:
#This command must be issued once about 2S, if there is no status message for a long time, the motherboard side may be disconnected
M4000
Return:
ok. B:-50/0 E1:-52 / 0 E2: 76/0 X:0.000 Y:0.000 Z:0.000 F:0/0 D:0/0/0 T:0
B: hot bed current temperature / target temperature
E1: thermal Head 1 current temperature / target temperature
E2: thermal Head 2 current temperature / target temperature
X, Y,Z:coordinate position, in mm
F: Extrusion Head 1 fan PWM / extrusion Head 2 fan the maximum value is 256
D: SD ocation of card currently Read/ total size of file currently read on SD card / whether pause
, When the file is not open, the total size is 0, the pause flag is only valid when the file is open, and 1 is paused
T: when the file has started, only the file starts printing is valid
Move command:
X axis plus G0 X10 F1200 I0 \ r \ \ n #X axis moves right 10mm, at a speed of 1200mm/s per minute movement
X axis minus G0 X-10 F1200 I0 \r \ \ n
Y axis plus G0 Y10 F1200 I0 \r \ n
Y-axis minus G0 Y-10 F1200 I0 \r \ n
Z axis plus G0 Z10 F600 I0 \r \ n
Z-axis minus G0 Z-10 F600 I0 \r \ \ n
E axis plus G0 E10 F300 I0 \r \ \ n
E-axis minus G0 E-10 F300 I0 \r \ \ n
HOME zero G28\r \ \ n
Heating extrusion head Command:
M104 S60 #heated to 60 degrees, followed by S is the temperature of the degree of execution
Heating hot bed command:
M140 S60 #is heated to 60 degrees, followed by S is the temperature of the degree of execution

Fan on.:
M106 S127 #fan on, PWM is 127, maximum is 256
Fan off:
M107
Emergency stop.:
M112 #stop all the motors
Extended Command:
Display the file list: / / note transcoding, sent up must be m4001 information returned encoding
M20
Normal returns the following results, the board will return a line by line：
Begin file list\r\n #
First file 34343\r\n #file name file size (bytes)
Second file 34233\r \ \ n
End file list\r \ n #end of file list
Select the SD card and print: / / note transcoding, the file must be sent down m4001 encoding information returned
M6030 'file name' #such as M6030 ' file.gcode'
Start or resume printing:
M24.
Pause printing:
M25
Stop printing:
M33.
Create file: / / note transcoding, the file must be sent down m4001 information returned encoding
M28 file name#such as M28 new_file.gcode
In the case of the file is not closed(such as printing), return Error!File: test.gcode is opened\ \ r \ \ n
,Where"test.gcode " is the name of the file that has been opened
Delete file: / / note transcoding, the file must be sent down M4001 information returned encoding
M30 file name#such as M30 new_file.gcode
Write the file：
After the M28 file is created
All commands except the M4000 and M29 are treated as write data, and the effective data length of a package is recommended to be 256 * 5 or
Shorter
The data written is formatted as follows：
/ Valid data (data length) / data in the file offset (4byte)|
Test (1byte, XOR operation of all preceding data) / 0x83(1byte) |
If an incorrect test or data loss occurs, you receive the following message:
resend 32432\r\\ N where 32432 is the offset of the data to be retransmitted in the file
If a write error occurs, it will receive:
Error:write dat\r\ \ n
Write the end of the file:
M29.
Read files:
M6032 'file name' #such as M28 'new_file.gcode'
Successful return ok L: file length, such as ok L:3128340
Failure returns Error:.....
Then request data read out with M3000 request data read out, the data format of the data format to write the file when the return of the same
If the data is lost, request the retransmission of the data at the specified file offset with M3001 Ixxx, such as M3001 I324242
Turn off the device, after printing the shutdown module of the device, the command will let the device power off：
M4003
Querying the current command blocking condition：
M4004.
